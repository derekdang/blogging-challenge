I have some great news to share with you all. As of this past Friday I am no longer on the job market for the time being. I gladly accepted an offer to work for PlayStation as a Backend Software Engineer starting 2023/12/04. 

It has been a long journey to get to the point where I am. I shared with friends that I began to doubt my competency and abilities. The interview process took a toll on me and it was a huge weight off my shoulders to have an offer in hand. I went through periods of being proactive about applying and periods of discouragement and feeling hopeless. It is crazy to think it has been about a year since I was let go and nine months of searching for work.

It is a liberating feeling to not have to check LinkedIn jobs daily and as my friend put it "blasting applications into the void". I was elated when I received the news on Monday. It is nice to have this period of funemployment where I can decompress and wind down from the taxing job search. I initially was going to keep track of "metrics" by the number of emails in my Updates section of my inbox but that became too discouraging as it grew into the 1000+ range.

Reviewing my calendar and some of the information tracked in emails:
* 7 or 8 virtual onsites
* 2 roles where virtual onsites were canceled / positions were eliminated
* Dozens of tech screens
* Dozens of recruiter calls
* 1 interview for a SWE position in Japan
* Ballpark of 1000 applications

The terms of my employment will last six months with a possibility for extension or conversion to full time employment. While a Contract role was not ideal or what I had pictured, I believe this is the only door God has opened in nine months and where He wants me at.
