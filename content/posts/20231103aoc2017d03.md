This one is a doozy. Spirals for matrices is something I actually cannot *wrap* my head around. I have struggled with [Spiral Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/) LC problem as well. I felt like this problem was more difficult than the majority of the sixteen days I have completed so far for 2017. I definitely brought this upon myself and spent embarrassingly more time than I should have.

#### Part 1

I made silly assumptions like the Manhattan Distance must be less than the square size. I was stuck on this for a while and was insistent on using my code and logic that would not work. For part 1, for square 13, the coordinate distance from the origin (assuming origin of square 1 is 0,0) is 2,2. Square size is 4 and Manhattan distance is 4. Obviously that assumption did not hold for square of size 2 either. These are massive oversights on my end. 

After adjusting my paradigm and discarding my assumptions I basically hard coded the first two iterations of the spiral because it was easier to do so and they felt more like edge cases. Square 1 is straightforward since it is 0 directions to change. Calculating the logic for for Square 2 is a bit of a nightmare since it goes three directions. Right. Up. Left. 

I think that this type of problem is my Achilles' heel and cryptonite. As I was drafting up this writeup, I realize that my code logic still operates in three directions for each iteration when we generate the respective spiral matrix for each square size. The first point generated for each iterations carries on in the same direction as the previous spiral before changing directions.

```py
plot_points = {1: [0,0], 2: [1,0], 3: [1,1], 4: [0,1]}
...
for i in range(3, target_square_size + 1):
        move = spiral_dir[spiral_order[spiral_ind]]
        plot_points[num] = [move[0] + last_point[0], move[1] + last_point[1]]
        last_point = plot_points[num]

        num += 1
        update_spiraldir_and_move()
        ...
```

When I initially solved Part 1 two months ago, I realized all odd square values are directly to the bottom right. 1, 9 (1, -1),25 (2, -2). From there it was calculating where my square would be located. For my input **289326**, I took the `sqrt` and found the next odd square size that would enumerate it in our spiral, **539**. From there it was figuring out how far away **290521** was from **289326**. I did not have any code that would be able to programatically for part two so I left it there unsolved.


#### Part 2
It was trivial to go from part 1 to part 2. We can flip the key, value pairs for our dictionary and define an array for the cardinal and intercardinal directions. The value for each point is now the sum of the values of all neighbors that have been generated so far in the spiral.

```py
neighbors = [[0,1], [0,-1], [1,0], [-1,0], [1,1], [1,-1], [-1,1], [-1,-1]]
plot_points = {(0,0): 1, (1,0): 1, (1,1): 2, (0,1):  4}
...
for n in neighbors:
    neighbor = (new_move[0] + n[0], new_move[1] + n[1])
    if neighbor in plot_points:
        value += plot_points[neighbor]
plot_points[new_move] = value
...
```

#### Learnings and Takeaways

* Exercise more care in walking through examples.
* Be ready to discard assumptions and code sooner.

I finally revisited it because I wanted to and to struggle through it. I am not super thrilled about the code I produced for this problem. It was a grind for sure but I am happy to have solved it. I definitely will not be refactoring.

If I was participating in year 2017 live I would have likely tried something like plugging in the sequence after having solved part 1 without code. [Square spiral of sums of selected preceding terms, starting at 1](https://oeis.org/A141481). 

Since I am attempting year 2017 six years later, it is not in the spirit of how I am approaching these problems. 

Out of the sixteen days solved, [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/11) is the only one I needed help for so far courtesy of [Hexagonal Grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/).
