## Advent of Code Year: 2017 Day: 17
[Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/17)

### Spinlock

#### Part 1
We are given a circular buffer (or essentially a list that wraps from tail to head). After moving N steps we insert the next number into the buffer from our sequence of 1 to 2017. Our new position is at the index we inserted the new element at. Once we reach 2017 we are interested in the number that is after 2017 in the buffer. Part 1 revolved mainly around ensuring your logic is correct for what index you are at.

```py
if index + num_steps >= len(buffer):
    index = (index + num_steps) % len(buffer)
else:
    index += num_steps
return index

...
for i in range(1, BUFFER_LIMIT):
    index = find_new_pos(num_steps, index, buffer)
    buffer.insert(index + 1, i)
    index = index + 1
```

#### Part 2
Now we want to insert up to *50 Million* instead of 2017. Notice that even if the index is the last element we would be adding to the `tail` in essence. In other words, 0 will remain at the beginning of our buffer. From there the solution should become apparent, we are interested in the last element to be inserted after `index 0`. Now to improve the runtime we no longer need to store the elements. Inserting at an index is expensive `O(n)` not to mention having an array of 50 million items.

```py
for i in range(1, BUFFER_LIMIT):
    index = find_pos2(num_steps, index, buffer)
    if index + i % buffer == 0:
        last_insertion_after_zero = i
    ...
```
### Learnings and Takeaways

My sentiments feel confirmed that the difficulty scaling has not been calibrated to where future years are at. For context, this is the most stars I have achieved without getting any outside help. The only problem so far I have needed help with was the Hexagonal grid. Later years involve concepts such as backtracking, more complex Graph Traversal algorithms, building on your IntCode computer, and the like. My pipe dream of solving all 25 problems for a year is alive!

```py

def find_new_pos(num_steps: int, index: int, buffer: list[int]) -> int:
    if index + num_steps >= len(buffer):
        index = (index + num_steps) % len(buffer)
    else:
        index += num_steps
    return index

def find_pos2(num_steps: int, index: int, buffer: int) -> int:
    if index + num_steps >= buffer:
        index = (index + num_steps) % buffer
    else:
        index += num_steps
    return index

def p1(num_steps: int) -> int:
    BUFFER_LIMIT = 2018
    buffer = [0]
    index = 0
    for i in range(1, BUFFER_LIMIT):
        index = find_new_pos(num_steps, index, buffer)
        buffer.insert(index + 1, i)
        index = index + 1
    return buffer[index + 1]

def p2(num_steps: int) -> int:
    BUFFER_LIMIT = 50_000_001
    buffer = 1
    last_insertion_after_zero = 0
    index = 0
    for i in range(1, BUFFER_LIMIT):
        index = find_pos2(num_steps, index, buffer)
        if index + i % buffer == 0:
            last_insertion_after_zero = i
        index = index + 1
        buffer += 1
    return last_insertion_after_zero

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input = 329
    print(f"Part 1 Num in buffer after 2017: {p1(input)}")
    # 20 seconds for part 2
    print(f"Part 2 Num after index 0 after 50 million insertions: {p2(input)}")
```
