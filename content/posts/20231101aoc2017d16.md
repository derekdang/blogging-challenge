## Advent of Code Year: 2017 Day: 16
[Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/16)

### Permutation Promenade

#### Part 1
We are going line dancing! At least that is how I pictured it in my head. We have programs standing in line from `a` to `p`. 

Our dancing manuevers consist of three actions. We can either `spin`(rotate) a specified amount or `swap` by index or `swap` by chars.

Pretty straightforward. 

#### Part 2
Now that we got our two left feet sorted out. We are interested in how we are arranged after doing our dance **1 Billion** times ðŸ˜‚. I spoke too soon (refer to my Year 2017 Day 15 post talk about cycles and numerous iterations).

Finding the cycle was simple with a dictionary that kept track of the programs' order and the first index we were arranged in that order. From there we simply do `1_000_000_000 % len(our_dict)` to find the index that we would be on after 1 billion iterations. Iterate over the items of our dictionary until we find the matching index and voila.

```py
if line_dance in program_orders and i != program_orders[line_dance]:
            break
...
for line, index in program_orders.items():
        if index == DANCE_TOTAL % len(program_orders):
            line_dance = line
            break
```

### Learnings and Takeaways

Some of my goals of participating in Advent of Code or even revisiting these older years is to learn nuances of a programming language. In this instance I am trying trying to do things in the most `pythonic` way possible and by "standard `python` conventions". 

One weak point I noticed is that I am not great with `regular expressions`. I will be attempting to utilize `regex` more when parsing input. There are probably cases where it would be easier and more human readable if I just made use of `split` (today being the case). 

* Use regex to parse puzzle input!

```py
# https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/16
import sys
import re

def swap(line_dance: list[str], i: int, j: int) -> str:
    tmp = line_dance[i]
    line_dance[i] = line_dance[j]
    line_dance[j] = tmp
    return "".join(line_dance)

def swap_chars(line_dance: list[str], i: str, j: str) -> str:
    i_ind = line_dance.index(i)
    j_ind = line_dance.index(j)
    line_dance[j_ind] = i
    line_dance[i_ind] = j
    return "".join(line_dance)

def spin(line_dance: str, i: int) -> str:
    return line_dance[-i:] + line_dance[:len(line_dance)-i]

def p1(line_dance: str, instructions: list[str]) -> str:
    for instruction in instructions:
        if instruction[0] == 's':
            num = int(re.findall(r'\d+', instruction[1:])[0])
            line_dance = spin(line_dance, num)
        elif instruction[0] == 'x':
            nums = re.split(r'\/', instruction[1:])
            line_dance = swap(list(line_dance), int(nums[0]), int(nums[1]))
        elif instruction[0] == 'p':
            programs = re.split(r'\/', instruction[1:])
            line_dance = swap_chars(list(line_dance), programs[0], programs[1])
    return line_dance

def p2(line_dance: str, instructions: list[str]) -> str:
    DANCE_TOTAL = 1_000_000_000
    program_orders = {}
    
    for i in range(DANCE_TOTAL):
        line_dance = p1(line_dance, instructions)
        # entered a cycle
        if line_dance in program_orders and i != program_orders[line_dance]:
            break
        if line_dance not in program_orders:
            program_orders[line_dance] = i+1
    for line, index in program_orders.items():
        if index == DANCE_TOTAL % len(program_orders):
            line_dance = line
            break
    return line_dance

if __name__ == "__main__":
    input = open(sys.argv[1]).read().split(',')
    line_dance = "abcdefghijklmnop"
    print(f"Part 1 Program Order after 1 Dance: {p1(line_dance, input)}")
    print(f"Part 2 Order after 1 Billion Dances: {p2(line_dance, input)}")
```
