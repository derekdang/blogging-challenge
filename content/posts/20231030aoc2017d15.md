## Advent of Code Year: 2017 Day: 15
[Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/15)

### Dueling Generators

#### Part 1
This day was relatively simple and straightforward. We are given two numbers and we apply some operations to them to generate our pairs. Then we compare the last 16 bits of their binary representation to see whether they match. 

#### Part 2
I struggled with reading comprehension here. We narrowed down the pairs we are interested in with certain criteria. Thankfully we are only now concerned about the first five million pairs that meet this filter.

### Learnings and Takeaways

- Forgot about negative indices for slicing or obtaining the `last 16 bits`.
- Forgot about `zip()`

For these questions when we are considering fourty million pairs, I always think that I am going to have to deduct the pattern. In later years when the problems involve these large numbers, you often have to figure out **"Oh, every 5489 operations adds another 32 to our result set**. or **"[X adds 2767 lines of height every 1745 rocks starting at rock 1459](https://github.com/derekdang/adventofcode2022/blob/main/day17/main.py#L161C29-L161C93)** so calculate the height after one trillion iterations.

I wonder if this day was meant to give a small reprieve to the participants as they near the final ten days. 2017 is also relatively young in the *advent* of Advent of Code so perhaps complexity and scale of the problems were still being ironed out at this time.
