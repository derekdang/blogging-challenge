title: "Candidate Horror Story"
date: 2023-10-17
draft: true
---

I am coming up on nearly one year being laid off and almost nine months of on and off job searching. I wanted to share some horror stories from the candidate side of things. Hopefully this provides either some laughs or entertainment ðŸ˜‚.

This process I had with XYZ corp was one of the worst candidate experiences I have ever had. Initially, I proceeded through the recruiter phone call and technical screen well. From that point onward it took me nearly a month to get scheduled for the virtual onsite. Eventually the recruiter put me in direct contact with the recruiting coordinator to get it done.

**That was not even the worst part.**\
My virtual onsite was scheduled over the course of three days. After conducting the first interview on Day 1, I receive a phone call from the recruiter, A, ten minutes before my interview on Day 2 telling me the position has been eliminated.

I was irate at the moment after how much effort I invested into interviewing for this position. I did not blow up over the phone but I was seething.

Below is my email exchange with names redacted below.

Hi Derek,

 

Hope you are well! I wanted to follow up with you and see how you felt like the interview went the other day with X? I wanted to let you know he enjoyed speaking with you and recommend the next steps in the interview process. ðŸ˜Š

 

Could you provide windows of availability asap by chance? It will 3, one hour interviews with team members to complete the process.

Thank you and look forward to hearing from you.
