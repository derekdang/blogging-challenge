I enjoy Advent of Code loads more than LeetCode or other coding challenges for some reason. I have spent hours on problems for Advent of Code but would readily give up on LC problems before that duration. Maybe the endorphins of getting those gold stars ‚≠ê is really enticing.

Because I enjoy Advent of Code, I figured I would take a page out of other participants' books and do write ups for my solutions, thoughts, challenges, and learnings/takeaways. I plan to do this for Advent of Code 2023 which is coming soon!

I will be starting midway since I am currently working through year 2017.

<h2> Advent of Code Year: 2017 Day: 14 </h2>

[Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/14)

This problem makes use of the Knot Hash we implemented in [Day 10 of 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/10). I had to refresh myself of what my code did. From there most of this day was trivial.

We had to append `-` + `{num_row}` to our input before performing our knot hash. From there we converted our knot hash to binary resulting in our 128 bit binary string for our "Disk Defragmenter". Repeat that for all 128 rows and we have the state of our grid.

```py
def hex_to_bin(c: str, num_bits: int) -> str:
    return str(bin(int(c, 16))[2:].zfill(num_bits))
```

Part 1 was counting the bits that were used which corresponded to `1`. 

Part 2 was essentially [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) from LeetCode where are islands are `regions`. This was trivial with DFS and recursion while keeping track of coordinates visited with a set.

```py
def helper(grid: list, visited: set, r: int, c: int):
    if (r,c) in visited or r < 0 or r == 128 or c < 0 or c == 128 or grid[r][c] == '0':
        return

    visited.add((r,c))
    helper(grid, visited, r-1, c)
    helper(grid, visited, r+1, c)
    helper(grid, visited, r, c-1)
    helper(grid, visited, r, c+1)
```

<h3> Learnings and Takeaways </h3>

- Making use of `zfill` and `bin` and `int(c, 16)`.
- Zero recollection of what my code did from the Day 10 solution.
- Less magic numbers.
- Are tuples as keys slow for a set or dictionary?

I know that a good majority of participants are interested in how long their solution takes to run. For the most part that is not my goal but rather to have something I am content with. There is some improvement to be done for my `Knot Hash`.
