Quick thought, I am not disciplined. There is not necessarily a standard that I am holding myself to but if I took a step back and attempt to objectively view my life, I would say I do not have a large amount of discipline.

Here is how I would rank areas of my life with regards to discipline:

### Good Discipline
* All things weight room related (lifting, bulking, cutting)
* Laundry
* Sleep Hygiene
    * Getting out of bed / waking up regularly
    * Sleeping regularly
* Social Media Consumption 
* Inbox 0

### Poor Discipline
* Devotional time
* Maintaining relationships
* Practicing/studying Japanese
* Cooking
* Cleaning

### Unknown
* Writing consistently

Definitely lots of room for improvement!
