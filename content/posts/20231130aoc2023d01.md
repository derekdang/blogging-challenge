## Advent of Code Year: 2023 Day: 01
[Day 01](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

### Trebuchet?!

That time of year again! Advent of Code officially started at 21:00 PST on 11/30. I am a bit rusty after taking it easy these past two weeks. Refer to my last post to see why I could relax for a bit ðŸ˜Š.

My metrics for this day's puzzle is as follows:

**Part 1 solved in 00:03:09 for Rank 777**\
**Part 2 solved in 00:35:26 for Rank 3995**

#### Part 1
Jumping right into it. We are being launched into the air by a trebuchet and a certain elf took some artistic liberties with the calibration document.

For part 1 we need to parse each line for two numbers, the first digit we encounter from the beginning of our string and the last digit we encounter.
Concatenate the values and add it to our sum.

`pqr3stu8vwx` would result in `38` for the line.
```py
for char in line:
    if char.isdigit():
        first_num = char
        break
for char in reversed(line):
    if char.isdigit():
        second_num = char
            break
num = first_num + second_num
sum += int(num)
```

I was able to get part 1 done pretty quickly but my rustiness comes in for part 2.

#### Part 2
Part two adds to our parsing logic. Some of the lines will have numbers written as a word.\

`two1nine` would now result in `29` instead of 11.\
`7pqrstsixteen` now results in `76`.

We can modify our existing code to keep track of the indices at which we encounter a number whether it be in digit or word form, making use of `rfind` for finding the last number we encounter.

```py
for i,char in enumerate(line):
    if char.isdigit():
        index_one = i
        first_num = char
        break
...
for key in map:
    if key in line:
        if line.find(key) < index_one:
            index_one = line.find(key)
            first_num = map[key]
```

### Learnings and Takeaways
I made many silly errors and I let the pressure get to me since I did ok in part 1. My sorry excuses are that I am not a night owl so programming challenges at 9pm will definitely be times where I am more error prone. I definitely would not participate when it goes live if I resided in Eastern US time zones. To the east coasters participating on release, you have my respect.

Hoping to focus up and shake off the rust as the event progresses!
