## Introduction

I decided I wanted to start jotting down thoughts, ideas, reflections as I start this new year of my life.

This is a small journey I am embarking on in order to track progress and see where I was (physically/headspace/current events) at this point in my life.

Some of these posts may just be rambling to myself while others may journal what I did on that unmonumental day. 

I am unsure of how consistent I can be with posting but I do have some lofty aspirations. Following some introspection I found that I am wasting too much time either watching anime or Twitch.\
I happened upon a video called "How to Code Everyday" and while I didn't find it a particularly helpful video.. I can appreciate some of the sentiments and ideas communicated.

To try and get myself out of my rut, I am going to spend my best time of the day coding or studying Japanese and leave the tedious tasks for later.

A little bit about my life at the moment:
* 29 y.o. unemployed software engineer
* Playing lots of volleyball 🏐
* Studying 日本語 - taking Japanese 102 at a CC
* Wrapping up a three month cut from 180lbs -> ? (currently down 15 lbs)
* Playing Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak on the Switch 🎮
