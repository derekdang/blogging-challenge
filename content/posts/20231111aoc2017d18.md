## Advent of Code Year: 2017 Day: 18
[Day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/18)

### Duet

#### Part 1

Day 18 was simple for the most part. We are asked to implement seven instructions that perform different operations. There was not anything too tricky itself about the operations. Many of them revolve around taking a value from our `registers` and performing a simple math operation using  either another integer value or the value for another register.

I would say mainly having the instructions handling the logic correctly between whether to interpret the value as a number or to look up the value of the register is the main concept to keep in mind.

```py
def add_register(registers: dict, r: str, val: str):
    num = registers[r] if r in registers else 0
    if is_number(val):
        registers[r] = num + int(val)
    else:
        num_v = registers[val] if val in registers else 0
        registers[r] = num + num_v
```

#### Part 2

We are now told that two of the instructions we have implemented actually have represent something else and in turn have different behaviors. We now have two programs operating simultaneously with a `message queue` to be able to `send` and `receive` values from each other. 

Our code should now terminate when both programs are waiting to receive a value and both message queues are empty. "the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value."

We achieve this easily with a queue and popping the first element. We know that both programs would be in a `deadlock` if the index for where they are in their instructions is the same after attempting to execute it.

```py
index_p0, _ = process_instr(registers_p0, instr_p0, msq_p1, msq_p0, index_p0)
index_p1, p1_sent = process_instr(registers_p1, instr_p1, msq_p0, msq_p1, index_p1)
...
if prev_index_p0 == index_p0 and prev_index_p1 == index_p1: 
    return num_p1_sent 
```

### Learnings and Takeaways

As I mentioned at the top, I did not feel particularly challenged by the question. One part that tripped me up was not realizing `jump` also can take an integer for its X value. I realized my puzzle input had one jump instruction like that after debugging.

```py

def is_number(s: str) -> bool:
    try:
        int(s)
        return True
    except ValueError:
        return False
    
def set_register(registers: dict, r: str, val: str):
    if is_number(val):
        registers[r] = int(val)
    else:
        registers[r] = registers[val] if val in registers else 0

def add_register(registers: dict, r: str, val: str):
    num = registers[r] if r in registers else 0
    if is_number(val):
        registers[r] = num + int(val)
    else:
        num_v = registers[val] if val in registers else 0
        registers[r] = num + num_v

def mul_register(registers: dict, r: str, val: str):
    if r not in registers:
        registers[r] = 0
        return
    num = registers[r]
    if is_number(val):
        registers[r] = num * int(val)
    else:
        num_v = registers[val] if val in registers else 0
        registers[r] = num * num_v

def mod_register(registers: dict, r: str, val: str):
    num = registers[r] if r in registers else 0
    if is_number(val):
        registers[r] = num % int(val)
    else:
        num_v = registers[val]
        registers[r] = num % num_v

def jump_register(registers: dict, r: str, val: str, index: int) -> int:
    if is_number(r) and int(r) > 0 or (r in registers and registers[r] > 0):
        if is_number(val):
            index += int(val)
        else:
            num_v = registers[val] if val in registers else 0
