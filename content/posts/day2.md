## Analysis Paralysis
Here goes day two. I wrote down some ideas of stuff I wanted to talk about. One thing that comes to mind especially as I start trying to write consistently is analysis paralysis. There has been a fair amount of articles written on this topic so I will be exploring my perspective. 

I believe this is a common struggle for me in different facets of my life. Whether it be interviewing, trying to start something new, responding to correspondence... the list goes on.

It is frustrating to deal with because in my head I know part of it is just sitting down and doing it (for starting something new). I would say one area I have this solved is in the weight room. I have a line of advice that I tell friends that are starting their lifting journey. 

> Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress.

I tell them that because it is easy to fret over having perfect form before increasing the weights or finding the right program. While I am not advocating increasing the weights until your form breaks down, keep striving to make progress in your lifts. Do not let reasons such as "my form is not textbook perfect" or selecting the right program prevent you from obtaining gains.

For me, some of the stuff I will write is so that I can overcome my own shortcomings and preach to myself. Do as I say and not as I do, right?

Even as I was trying to start blogging I was thinking things like...

"What is the best tool to use?"\
"What will be the most future proof?"\
"What are my goals with writing?"
"Who am I writing to?"\
"What type of writing do I want to do?"

There is an abundance of resources out there on blogging, what to write about, how to capture an audience and all that jazz. I am still figuring out the answer to some of those questions above but at some point you just need to take the first step. 

Sometimes my analysis paralysis kills off my motivation before I start whatever I am endeavoring to do. I do not think these are bad ideas to have in mind but I did not want that to stop me from writing. 

So I will say this again and mainly for myself:
> Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress.
