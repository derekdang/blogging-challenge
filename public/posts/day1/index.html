<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I decided I wanted to start jotting down thoughts, ideas, reflections as I start this new year of my life.</p>
<p>This is a small journey I am embarking on in order to track progress and see where I was (physically/headspace/current events) at this point in my life.</p>
<p>Some of these posts may just be rambling to myself while others may journal what I did on that unmonumental day.</p>
<p>I am unsure of how consistent I can be with posting but I do have some lofty aspirations. Following some introspection I found that I am wasting too much time either watching anime or Twitch.<br>
I happened upon a video called &ldquo;How to Code Everyday&rdquo; and while I didn&rsquo;t find it a particularly helpful video.. I can appreciate some of the sentiments and ideas communicated.</p>
<p>To try and get myself out of my rut, I am going to spend my best time of the day coding or studying Japanese and leave the tedious tasks for later.</p>
<p>A little bit about my life at the moment:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 y.o. unemployed software engineer</li>
<li>Playing lots of volleyball 🏐</li>
<li>Studying 日本語 - taking Japanese 102 at a CC</li>
<li>Wrapping up a three month cut from 180lbs -&gt; ? (currently down 15 lbs)</li>
<li>Playing Monster Hunter Rise + Sunbreak on the Switch 🎮</li>
</ul>
