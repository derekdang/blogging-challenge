      <description>Introduction I decided I wanted to start jotting down thoughts, ideas, reflections as I start this new year of my life.
This is a small journey I am embarking on in order to track progress and see where I was (physically/headspace/current events) at this point in my life.
Some of these posts may just be rambling to myself while others may journal what I did on that unmonumental day.
I am unsure of how consistent I can be with posting but I do have some lofty aspirations.</description>
